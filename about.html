            <p id=abouttext><b>Hi!</b>
                We are Crown Innovations, producers of the first ever Calf Pacifier! (To learn more about the Calf Pacifier, visit our <a href="products.html">Products Page</a>) <br><br>

                We started as a <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/about-fll">FIRST&reg; LEGO&reg; League</a> (FLL) team, the Gearbots, based out of Jasper County, Iowa. FLL is mainly a LEGO&reg; competition, but there is also a Project area that every team has to complete as well. The Project theme was Animal Allies, and teams had to come up with an innovative solution to better the interaction between animals and humans. Holly and Carlee raise bottle calves, and had been joking about how a pacifier for their calves would be nice. Eventually, we found out that a pacifier for calves has health benefits, and keeps calves from sucking on everything. We decided to run with the idea, and ended up making it to two international competitions within FLL. This motivated us to keep going with the idea even after FLL was over. That was over three years ago, and we have learned so much during this process about working as a team, business management, manufacturing, customer support, legal issues, and patenting. We are so thankful for this opportunity and can't wait to see what we learn next.<br><br>
                <b>Crown</b> - We want to glorify God in everything we do, and thank Him for this opportunity<br>
