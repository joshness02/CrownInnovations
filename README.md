#Crown Innovations Website

By Joshua and Caleb Ness

This website was created for Crown Innovations LLC, a business we (Caleb and Joshua) and some friends started a few years ago.

This website allows farmers to view our products, learn more about our team, submit an order, and chat with us.

NOTE: GitHub does not support the use of PHP, which is used by the contact and order forms, so these functions are not available. They will be supported on our actual website as soon as we get it published.
