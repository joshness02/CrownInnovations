We created this website for Crown Innovations LLC, a startup company based in Jasper County, IA, created 5 young entrepeneurs.
Crown Innovations sells (of all things) Calf Pacifiers. The website explains what those are :)
We are two of the members who helped start this company, and have learned quite a bit through the whole process!

Features of our website:
 - We wanted a website that is easy to navigate, gives the customer an easy way to order a Calf Pacifier (or other items in the future), and has a modern and consistent style which will make the website memorable.
 - Our blog page has events and information that we want customers to know about, so they can get a feel for how we operate. Instead of adding each individual blog post to the html directly, we used JavaScript and AngularJS to easily add in new blog posts with an image, date, and blog content, and sort the posts by date. We will continue to add blog posts in the future.
 - Our products page also uses JavaScript and AngularJS to add new products easily, with an image, short and long descriptions, price, and availability. Customers can place an order from the individual product page (as long as the item is in stock). An email is then sent to us with all the information about their order, and we send them an invoice through Square (https://squareup.com/). NOTE: Due to GitHub being a static web server, we cannot use PHP to send an email. We do have the PHP files created and will be able to use it once we publish our site to our current URL.
 - Our contact page gives customers an easy way to contact us. We also list our email and phone number to give customers alternate ways to contact us as well (we are currently in the process of getting a company number so we have a placeholder at the moment). The contact form also uses PHP to send us an email with their message and email address, so it also will not work on GitHub, but will eventually work on our URL.
 - Our about page tells the story of our team/company, as well as a short description of each member individually. We also list some of the people that have mentored and helped us the past few years (we couldn't have done most of this without their support!)
 - Our home page has a slideshow that gives easy access to different pages, and tells customers abouts us and/or what they should do next on our website.
 - Our styling is a sleek, modern-looking, fun design with light grey, white, black and red being the main colors used. Our favicon shows the Calf Pacifier logo, which is also black, white and red. White is the color used for most main content backgrounds, with a red underline on many of our titles. This helps seperate and draw attention to individual content. Grey is used as the background color behind the content containers. This helps give a subtle seperator for the content. We used red for many of the buttons to draw attention to them and easily show the customer what to do next. We rounded most of the containers to give the website a softer look. Since bottle calves (which is what our product is for) are usually raised by women and children, we wanted a fun design that draws their attention.
  - Transitions are a big thing for our website. We feel they help with the soft, fun environment. Whether it is the slideshow background sliding down to reveal information about a page, or a description fading in over a product, or the menu bar sliding down from the top, we tried to incorporate transitions in some (but not too many) places.
  - Our website can fit many different sized screens, and we tested it across many devices to makes sure. On mobile devices/small screens, the menu bar hides away until "summoned" with the button in the top right. Our main page lines all the page buttons on top of each other on mobile devices isntead of having them side by side like on desktops. The product page is similar, changing the number of products shown in a row depending on the size of the screen.
